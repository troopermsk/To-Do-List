<h1 align="center"> To-Do List </h1>
<h2 align="left">Description</h2>

<p>An implementation of a To-Do List, with an option to go into a personal to-do list in private/personal mode. A very simple course project that aims to build upon Programming Fundamentals in C Language.<br>
  Please note, this program was built when I first started as a student at Politecnico di Torino.
<ul>
  <li>The program essentially defines a custom data structure using C notation, and builds upon it with the concept of Linked List in the form of Arrays.</li>
  <li>In order to navigate through the to-do list we use pointers for the arrays. We also have a separate array structure for the Private or personal To-Do list. </li>
</ul>
